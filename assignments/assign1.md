# Assignment 1 

The assignment needs to be uploaded to the google classroom no later than 2/27 midnight. 

## Reading 

- Read Sections 14.1, 14.2, 14.3, 14.4, 14.5 from the main book 

- Watch videos 5,6, and 16 from the _Audio Signal Processing for ML_ tutorial 


## Implementation 

- Write a Python program that reads an audio file and extracts key sound features such as intensity (loudness) and pitch (fundamental frequency). Then plot these features as functions of time to analyze how they vary throughout the audio.

- Write  python program to perform the following tasks: 
  - Record or use given speech audio samples
  - Compute the frequency spectrum of the speech signals using the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)
  - Plot the frequency spectrum as well as the original waveform along with the sinusoidal components
  - Identify and discuss dominant frequencies and fundamental frequency (F0) for different spoken words or phonemes
  - Generate spectrograms by applying Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) on speech signals
  - Plot the spectrogram along with the spoken words (each word is written under each block in spectrogram)
  - Plot and interpret spectrograms and discuss formant patterns and phoneme distinctions
  - Explore different window sizes and overlaps and analyze their effect on time-frequency resolution
